# Visitor Pattern Refactoring Assignment
This assignment involves refactoring an existing Java codebase to implement the Singleton design pattern and improve the structure and readability of the code.
The process includes retrofitting a Singleton pattern into the Visitor class, modifying method signatures, moving instance methods while leaving delegates, and renaming methods to enhance clarity.
Each step ensures that the refactored code compiles and runs correctly, maintaining the original functionality.
The final deliverables include a series of files documenting the incremental changes made throughout the refactoring process.
