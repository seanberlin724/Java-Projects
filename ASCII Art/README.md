# Desciption:
Create a program that produces an ASCII art representation below.
The output will vary based on a constant in the program. 
By simply changing the constant the output will change (somewhat) dramatically.
The program matches the outputs shown for the given value of the SIZE constant. 
See "Desciption.pdf" for full deatils on implementation.
